# sass_finishing_touches

A simple list of finishing touches to make your SASS feel native 





## What is the purpose of this

So, I'm picky.  And one of the things I hate is when I'm in some web 
application, and I try to select text, and a huge amount of text which
should not be selectable gets into the selection.  (Hi webmail.)

Similarly, controlling the cursor type, making a purposeful choice
about themed vs native buttons, et cetera.

I'd like to start gathering a list that I can refer to of topics of
this form.
